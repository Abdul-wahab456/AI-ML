Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Description:
This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic competition, which is a beginner-friendly challenge in predictive analytics. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.
-> Key Features:
1.	Dataset: Data is taken from Kaggle's Titanic competition, including training (train.csv) and test (test.csv) datasets.
2.	Objective: Create a machine learning model to predict passenger survival (binary classification: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased).
3.	Pipeline:
o	Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
o	Model training using the Random Forest classifier.
o	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for improved accuracy.
4.	Evaluation: Performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics on the validation set and submission to Kaggle for leaderboard scoring.
-> Workflow:
1.	Data Analysis and Visualization:
o	Explored dataset features and relationships using pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
o	Visualized key attributes like survival rates by gender, age, and ticket class.
2.	Preprocessing:
o	Addressed missing values using SimpleImputer.
o	Encoded categorical variables with OneHotEncoder.
o	Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.
3.	Model Development:
o	Built pipelines to streamline data preparation and model training.
o	Trained a Random Forest model and optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
4.	Submission:
o	Generated a CSV file containing PassengerId and Survived columns for submission to the Kaggle competition.
