Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Description:
This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic competition, which is a beginner-friendly challenge in predictive analytics. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

Key Features:
Dataset: Data is taken from Kaggle's Titanic competition, including training (train.csv) and test (test.csv) datasets.
Objective: Create a machine learning model to predict passenger survival (binary classification: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased).
Pipeline:
Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
Model training using the Random Forest classifier.
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for improved accuracy.
Evaluation: Performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics on the validation set and submission to Kaggle for leaderboard scoring.
Workflow:
Data Analysis and Visualization:
Explored dataset features and relationships using pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Visualized key attributes like survival rates by gender, age, and ticket class.
Preprocessing:
Addressed missing values using SimpleImputer.
Encoded categorical variables with OneHotEncoder.
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.
Model Development:
Built pipelines to streamline data preparation and model training.
Trained a Random Forest model and optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
Submission:
Generated a CSV file containing PassengerId and Survived columns for submission to the Kaggle competition.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
